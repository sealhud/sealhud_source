- Alterar o widget dos pneus
- Delta a partir da primeira volta
- Delta usando all time best
- Delta continua quando invalida ((no Rehud existe essa função que é configurada ou não))
- So for example i would like to see tyre wear instead 99% to be 99,11% this way i can see on which corner i have the most wear and so i can try how to dave tyre
- Something else for suggestions.TXT: could you make the “all widgets off” setting an option when cycling through views 1,2,3? I’d like to have just one button bound to cycle through all the views, but don’t want to sacrifice one of the three layouts. Thanks!
- Another thing: Would it be possible to show a widget just when crossing start finish, like the vanilla standings, when you set the HUD to important information only? Maybe as an option to the widgets in general. Would be great if you look for immersion in general and just need info from time to time. Sure could also be made with hiding the HUD manually, but as before, would be just cool to have. Thinking about it, this might get a new visualization.

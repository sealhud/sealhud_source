- Temperatura de Oleo
- Temperatura de Motor
- Alterar o widget dos pneus
- Musica quando ganha corrida
- Mapear mais pistas
- Delta a partir da primeira volta
- (Pedro) - Delta continua quando invalida ((no Rehud existe essa função que é configurada ou não)) - Relative-Times Branch
- Mudar as bandeiras para sinais eletronicos em gif
- (Diego) - Marcar o piloto em bandeira amarela
- (Diego) - so for example i would like to see tyre wear instead 99% to be 99,11% this way i can see on which corner i have the most wear and so i can try how to dave tyre
- Something else for suggestions.TXT: could you make the “all widgets off” setting an option when cycling through views 1,2,3? I’d like to have just one button bound to cycle through all the views, but don’t want to sacrifice one of the three layouts. Thanks!
- (Pedro) - Tempo Relativo GAP - Relative-Times Branch
- Tempo de volta que está sendo exibido quando um piloto completa uma volta, parece não corresponder de fato à volta recém completada. Parece estar exibindo o tempo da volta anterior (isso pode ter relação com a forma com que o Otter criou para fazer os cálculos).
- Verificar glitch relatado com overlay discord. (Relatado no canal por vipersonix: Dear Sealhudders, is there a way to fix discord glitching when focused on the game? i have a great time when focused on the game but then on 2nd screen discord visually glitches out to black or gray, until certain amount of time passed or i focus on it.) Pode ser comportamento causado pelo webhud em si (raceroom browser), e não pelo sealhud.
- Some Ideas: Is it possible to show the HUD after a race is finished? When i play Multiplayer and finish the race, i sometimes want to check how much fuel is left or tire use, sure could look shortly before finishing but just forget it sometimes :D
Another thing: Would it be possible to show a widget just when crossing start finish, like the vanilla standings, when you set the HUD to important information only? Maybe as an option to the widgets in general. Would be great if you look for immersion in general and just need info from time to time. Sure could also be made with hiding the HUD manually, but as before, would be just cool to have. Thinking about it, this might get a new visualization.

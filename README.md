# SealHUD

**SealHUD** is a modern and advanced web-based HUD for **RaceRoom Racing Experience**.

Originally inspired by the OtterHud project, SealHUD is now a fully independent project with its own identity, architecture, and long-term vision, focused on stability, customization, and continuous evolution.

5. Run "Start SealHUD.bat". It will automatically check for updates and start the local SealHUD web server.
6. Make sure your **CrewChief** or **dash.exe** is updated to the latest version (only one of the two is required):  
👉 [Download CrewChief](https://thecrewchief.org/forumdisplay.php?28-Download-and-Links)<br>
👉 [Download dash.zip (latest)](https://sealhud.github.io/dash.zip)

**VERY IMPORTANT:**<br>
RaceRoom's shared memory requires local TCP port 8070 to share data. Certain third-party services (such as Razer Haptic) use this port, causing a conflict that prevents SealHUD from working. Check if TCP port 8070 is currently in use on your computer (using Windows Resource Monitor / resmon.exe). If it is, you can either disable the service using Windows Services (services.msc) or change the communication port used with RaceRoom, as described in this post: [SealHUD Forum Thread - change WebSocket Port on CrewChief](https://forum.kw-studios.com/index.php?threads/sealhud-webhud.20675/page-21#post-261276)
